# Kabbalah
Ok, so I wanted to reconstruct the discoveries in Torah published by Ellyahu Rips and after, in the book titled The Bible Code. In half of the project I gave up - first, that was too ridiculous, second - Rips doesn't give in his work (attached) any methods to find these revolutionary discoveries - which is kinda fishy. I leave this project here, because I had a hard time trying to find un-edited Torah in the internet (containing 304805 letters).
